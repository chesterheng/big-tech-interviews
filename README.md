# Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews

## Summary

- Arrays
  - hash map
  - two-pointer
- Strings
  - sliding window
- Linked Lists
  - singly vs doubly
  - cycle detection
- Stacks vs Queues
- Recursion
  - normal vs tail recursion
  - divide & conquer
    - multi-branched recursion
    - breaks a problem into multiple smaller but same sub-problems
    - combines the solutions of sub-problems into the solution for the original problem
  - patterns: if, for ([] within []), check for relationship between is n and n-1
  - sorting: quick sort, quick select
  - search: binary search
