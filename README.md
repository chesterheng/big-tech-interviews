# Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews

## Summary

- How to solve?
  - verify the constraints
  - write out some test cases
  - figure out a solution without code
  - write out our solution in code
  - double check for errors
- Arrays
  - hash map
  - two-pointer
- Strings
  - sliding window
- Linked Lists
  - singly vs doubly
  - cycle detection
- Stacks vs Queues
- Recursion
  - normal vs tail recursion
  - divide & conquer
    - multi-branched recursion
    - breaks a problem into multiple smaller but same sub-problems
    - combines the solutions of sub-problems into the solution for the original problem
  - patterns: if, for ([] within []), check for relationship between is n and n-1
  - sorting: quick sort, quick select
  - search: binary search 
- Binary Trees
  - search
    - breath first search
      - iterative
    - depth first search
      - recursion
      - determine traversal
  - traversal
    - pre-order traversal
    - in-order traversal
    - post-order traversal
  - maximum depth
    - number of nodes from root node to furthest leaf node
  - full tree
    - each node has either 0 or 2 children
  - complete tree
    - every level must be complete except last level is pushed as far left
  - binary search tree
    - all left nodes value < current node value
    - all right nodes value > current node value
    - no duplicate value
  - heaps
    - is a complete tree
    - max/min heap
    - use max heap to implement a priority queue
  - priority queue
    - holds a collection of elements, each with an associated priority
    - allows access the element with the highest priority
- 2D-Arrays
  - traversal
    - 4 directions: up, right, down, left
    - sequential search: scan 2D array in a zigzag pattern
    - breath first search: iterative
    - depth first search: recursion
  - values
    - limited or unlimited
